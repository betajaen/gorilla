      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        Gorilla is a C++ based HUD and simple 2D overlay system for the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D graphics engine</a>, it comes in two files Gorilla.cpp and Gorilla.h
      </p>
      <p>
Gorilla is intended to substitute the Ogre overlay system, and to provide a good framework and basis for any Ogre programmer to build their HUD or GUI system upon.</p>
      <p>
Gorilla is designed for speed; it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas">Texture Atlases</a> and tries to render everything in one batch.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
To include Gorilla in your project, simply copy the two Gorilla files Gorilla.cpp and Gorilla.h into your project. Making sure you correctly include and link to Ogre. To increase compliation speed you may want to <code>#include "Gorilla.h"</code> in your static headers file.</p>
      <p>
      All of Gorilla's classes are contained in the Gorilla namespace. All classes and member functions use the <code>camelCase</code> notation, with the exception that class names the first letter is always captialised.

      <h2>How Gorilla Works</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        To draw onto the Screen, Gorilla creates a number of "Quads" or two triangles that mark a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph">Glyph</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29">Sprite</a> or solid/gradient colour on the screen. These triangles all share the same source image, but reference only portions of that image. This way instead of sending multiple images to your Graphics card at once, only one is needed -- increasing render time and reducing memory usage. This process is colourfully described in the following image:
      </p>
      <p class="center"><img src="images/howitworks.png" class="gray_border" /></p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="grid_12 section">
      <h2>Texture Atlases</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="grid_8 alpha">
        <p>
         To know what portions of the image is what, Gorilla uses <code>.gorilla</code> file that gives the precise positions and sizes of the Glyphs and Sprites held within the image. These are simple text files easily editable by any Text Editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically a Gorilla file will contain the following;
        </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Location of a white pixel</li>
           <li>Font line heights, average sizing, base line height and letter spacing</li>
           <li>Glyph to Glyph kerning information</li>
           <li>Glyph sizes</li>
           <li>Sprite names, positions and sizes</li>
         </ul>
